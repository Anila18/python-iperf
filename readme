The format of the folder naming is as follows:
	The first number represents how many clients there are in the experiment.
	The letter 'L' distinguishes that the clients are running on the same machine, 
	and the 'R' distinguishes that they are running on different machines. Literally,
	L = local and R = remote.

	The second number represents how many servers are running for the experiment,
	and the letters hold the same meaning. Lastly, we distinguish any other necessary
	details for the test after the underscore. For example, tcp means that it was a tcp 
	test as opposed to a udp test.
